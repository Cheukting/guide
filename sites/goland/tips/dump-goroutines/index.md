leadin: "Regardless if it's for fun, or investigating a bug, having a quick look at what the application is doing and its memory is always useful.\n\n**How to use:**\n\nEither attach to the project using the debugger, or launch a debugging session. While the application is running, press the \U0001F4F7 button on the left side of the Debugger Tool Window.\n\n<span class=\"tag is-rounded\">New in 2020.3</span>\n"
