Been doing a lot of talking. Time for some action.

Let’s find and download PyCharm Professional Edition which we’ll be using in this series. I recommend giving it a try...it has a free 1-month trial. But feel free to follow along with your PyCharm Community Edition if you prefer.

## Finding and downloading
Ok, so, downloading PyCharm is as easy as clicking the [download button](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).

Your download begins in the background. 

## Installing
These [instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone) differ depending on your operating system.

On the very first launch of PyCharm Professional, you’ll be asked to log into your JetBrains account or start a free 30-day evaluation. Let's go with the latter for now. 

That’s it! We just went through the installation process, and now we can start using PyCharm.


## Welcome Screen

When you open PyCharm for the first time, you are presented with the Welcome Screen.

From PyCharm's Welcome Screen, there are four main sections you can explore. Let’s start with the **Learn PyCharm** tab.

Here you can use the links to jump to documentation pages and other resources, and you can also enroll in the interactive [Feature Trainer](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/feature-trainer.html) which is designed to quickly teach you some productivity boosters in PyCharm.

The **Plugins** tab lets you install some additional plugins like custom themes or keymaps if you are coming from other editors/IDEs.

Installing **Keymaps** makes your migration from other editors easier and painless. To search, just start typing “keymaps”, for example. As you see here, PyCharm starts listing available keymaps for popular editors. You can find the one that suits you best and just click it to install.

The **Customize** section lets you tweak some of the most commonly used settings. We can change our theme from Darcula to IntelliJ Light, for example. You can also sync with the OS if you prefer. If you have installed any keymap or themes plugin you would need to switch it here as well.

Finally, on the **Projects** tab, you can create, open, or clone projects to start working with.

## Conclusion
In this step we learned how to download and install PyCharm, and we also went through the Welcome screen.
I hope this video was useful for you. 

In the next step, we’ll see how to start our first project in PyCharm.
