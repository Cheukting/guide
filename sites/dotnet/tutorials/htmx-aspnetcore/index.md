Hi! I'm Khalid and welcome to my series on HTMX for ASP.NET Core Developers.

[ASP.NET](https://asp.net/) Core developers predominantly spend their development time on the server, trying their best to steer clear of the scary world of client-side development. But here's a secret, it doesn't have to be a daunting prospect to build client-side experiences if you use HTMX. Learn what HTMX is, how to integrate it with your existing knowledge of ASP.NET Core development, and how to take your client-side development to the next level with relative ease. You'll never look at client-side development the same way ever again.
