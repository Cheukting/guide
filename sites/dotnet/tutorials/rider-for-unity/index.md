Powerful C# features help you forget about tooling and concentrate on coding.
Jump to the exact code you need instantly, generate code as you type, and find and automatically fix problems before you hit them.

Rider's Unity specific inspections will find common errors, help you fix them, and suggest best practices to keep your game running smoothly.
Rider understands your serialized data, showing you serialized fields and method usages directly in the code editor and displaying Unity data right where you need it.

We'll look at these and other ways to get Rider to help you improve your game.
