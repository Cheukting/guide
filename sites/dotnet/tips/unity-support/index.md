Rider duplicates many of the frequently accessed Unity editor parts so that you don't find yourself tabbing through applications. This includes the explorer view, play-mode controls, test execution/visualization and more.\n- **Deep knowledge about Unity engine code** to help improving game performance. Rider continuously receives new code inspections that detect common mistakes specifically for the Unity platform. Refactorings and symbol searches even consider non-C# references, like in YAML files. Indicators tell us about hot paths in our code and the built-in profiler helps nailing down bottlenecks.\n\nThink of Rider as your co-pilot for fast and pleasant Unity game development! \U0001F3CE \U0001F3CE \U0001F3CE\n\n### See Also\n- [Working with Unity](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Unity.html)\n- [Getting started with Rider and Unity](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2017/08/30/getting-started-rider-unity/)\n- [Working with external class libraries in Unity and Rider](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/02/20/working-external-class-libraries-unity-rider/)\n- [Control Unity editor play mode with Rider 2018.1](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/04/05/control-unity-editor-play-mode-rider-2018-1/)\n- [View Unity console logs directly in Rider 2018.1](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/04/10/view-unity-console-logs-directly-rider-2018-1/)\n- [Unity Explorer and new code inspections in Rider 2018.1](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/06/14/unity-explorer-new-code-inspections-rider-2018-1/)\n- [Unity Package Explorer in Rider 2018.2](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/09/19/unity-package-explorer-rider-2018-2/)\n- [Unity Assembly Definition Files and Rider 2018.2](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/09/26/unity-assembly-definition-files-rider-2018-2/)\n- [Integrating Rider 2018.2 and the Unity Editor](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/10/03/integrating-rider-2018-2-unity-editor/)\n- [Unity-specific code analysis in Rider 2018.2](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/10/18/unity-specific-code-analysis-rider-2018-2/)\n- [Unity Performance Best Practices with Rider, Part 1](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2019/02/21/performance-indicators-unity-code-rider/)\n- [Unity performance best practice with Rider, part 2](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2019/02/28/performance-inspections-unity-code-rider/)\n"
