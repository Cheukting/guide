leadin: "**Meet the VCS Operations Quicklist** \U0001F3F7\n\nSwitching branches, committing changes, viewing file history, or comparing revisions. With the VCS Operations quicklist, those actions are both, **systematically listed and easy to reach**. Furthermore, the quicklist supports _just typing_ to filter results, and shows indicators for branches to see incoming and outgoing changes.\n\nA little cream topping is the automatic restore of **workspaces** whenever we switch a branch. This ensures that we get our previous environment back, including opened files, favorites, breakpoints, and more.\n\nBy the way, quicklists can be customized! \U0001F92B\n\n## See Also\n- [Version Control Integration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Version_Control_Integration.html)\n- [Using Git Integration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Using_Git_Integration.html)\n- [Local History](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/local_history.html)\n- [Work with Context](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-tasks-and-context.html#work-with-context)\n"
