If you missed them, check out [part one](../upload-a-file-to-s3/) and [part two](../upload-a-file-to-s3-unit-test/) of this blog post series first.

In the blog post Isabel explains how to perform integration testing for uploading files to Amazon S3 using AWS SDK for Kotlin. The post is part of a series focused on teaching developers how to seamlessly integrate AWS services with Kotlin applications.

The article starts by differentiating integration tests from unit tests, emphasizing that integration tests validate the interaction between different components, such as the actual communication with AWS S3 in this case. It stresses the importance of integration testing for ensuring that your application works correctly with external systems.

Before diving into the code, the author outlines the prerequisites as an AWS account, an S3 bucket, and a Kotlin project configured with AWS SDK dependencies. Detailed steps for setting up these prerequisites are provided, ensuring even beginners can follow along.

The blog then focuses on how to set up the environment for integration testing. It recommends configuring AWS credentials securely and setting up environment variables to manage these credentials. This step ensures that the application can authenticate and interact with AWS services during testing.

Next, Isabel provides detailed instructions on writing integration tests. The process involves creating an actual AWS S3 client and performing operations within a testing framework like JUnit. Code snippets demonstrate how to upload a file to an S3 bucket and verify the upload by checking the bucket's content.

Key aspects covered include error handling and cleaning up the test environment after execution to avoid unnecessary charges and clutter in the S3 bucket. The author even suggests best practices for writing maintainable and reliable tests, such as using proper assertions and structuring tests for readability.

In summary, the blog post serves as a comprehensive guide to conducting integration tests for file uploads to Amazon S3 using AWS SDK for Kotlin. It provides clear instructions, useful code examples, and best practices to help developers ensure their applications work correctly with AWS S3.
