C# is a very popular language, and there are a lot of C# developers out there. There is a constant desire for C# skills to be transferable across game engines, and this is especially true given the recent events surrounding Unity and the increasing popularity of alternative engines targeting the indie dev market.

But how transferable are C# skills from engine to engine? How do you evaluate the viability of the C# support on an engine you don't know? What do AOT, JIT, and Mono mean? If you want to embed C# in your engine, how do you do that?

This talk will answer all these questions and more, covering what you need to know about C# and the .NET ecosystem in the game industry, clarifying the jargon, going over existing engine support, explaining platform constraints and portability, and providing practical examples of how to embed C# in a game engine, as well as providing relevant online resources.
