In this session, we’ll take a look at how to configure typical Unity and Unreal Engine build pipelines, including executing tests, building games for various platforms, and deploying to staging environments. We’ll also explore some of the built-in productivity-enhancing features offered by TeamCity, including build chains for automatic pipeline optimizations, parallel tests to shorten overall test execution times, and cloud agents to automatically spin-up additional build agents when needed.
