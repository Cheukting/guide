Building and packaging Unreal Engine-based games is notoriously difficult. Achieving modern continuous integration and continuous delivery levels for them is even harder. In this talk, we’ll present and review the solution developed by Sprocket Games to build a modern multiplatform Unreal project in AWS, leveraging Epic’s BuildGraph system and TeamCity’s Kotlin DSL. Using this system, Sprocket Games has transitioned from overhead-heavy, bi-weekly playtests to near-painless daily playtests.
