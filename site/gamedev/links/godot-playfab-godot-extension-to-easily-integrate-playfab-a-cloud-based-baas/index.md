Today, all games – whether single or multiplayer – need a backend.

But game devs want to build games, not backends (well, with some very rare exceptions).

Enter PlayFab, a free backend-as-a-service solution (up to 100k users). But how do you interact with it in your favorite game engine, Godot, with your favorite scripting language, GDScript?

In this session, we’ll show you how to leverage godot-playfab, the Godot/GSDScript SDK Johannes maintains, so you can make the most of it in your Godot game!
