Developing continuously high-quality mobile games, with their frequent updates and large user bases, requires the use of good CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) tools and practices.

However, the unique and complex requirements of building, testing, and deploying mobile games make configuring mobile CI/CD from scratch a daunting task.

These requirements include:

- Setting up build environments (especially macOS for iOS)

- Installing the Unity editor

- Activating the Unity license

- Preparing the build script

This session provides an easy-to-follow introduction to creating a scalable and cloud-native mobile game CI/CD environment using CircleCI, GameCI, and Unity.

This approach will provide you with the following benefits and ultimately enable you to continuously deliver high-quality mobile games by:

- Increasing developer productivity and reducing maintenance overheads with scalable, on-demand, pre-configured build environments in the cloud, including M1 Mac.

- Reducing maintenance overheads by eliminating the need for complex custom build scripts
