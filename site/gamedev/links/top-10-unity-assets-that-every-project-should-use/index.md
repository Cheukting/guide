The talk discusses the top 10 assets and third-party game development kits, describing their advantages and disadvantages. It uses the example of a real app (Keiki World) that my team and I are working on. These resources benefit both beginners and experienced developers, making the game creation process easier. The list includes assets such as Amplify Shader Editor, Cinemachine, Firebase, DOTween, Dependency Hunter/Finder, Odin Serializer, Procedural UI Image + UI Gradient, and SR-debugger. Each asset is briefly described, and an overview of its features and benefits is provided.
