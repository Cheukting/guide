This talk will take the shape of a live demonstration, showcasing how to use the Kotlin programming language as well as the JVM ecosystem alongside the Godot game engine.

It will be split into three parts:

How to build and run Kotlin code within Godot.

How to use Kotlin idiomatic language features in your game.

How to make game development easier using the wide range of libraries in the JVM ecosystem.

The demonstration will make use of [this project](https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin-jvm).
