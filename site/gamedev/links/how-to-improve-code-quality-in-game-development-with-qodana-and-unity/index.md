[JetBrains Qodana](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/) is a code quality platform that extends static analysis to team reviews in CI/CD systems.
It lets your team collaborate more effectively -- especially when it comes to setting code review standards and quality gates.

[Our VR Unity team decided to take Qodana for a spin on an internal Unity project](https://blog.jetbrains.com/qodana/2024/01/how-to-improve-code-quality-in-game-development-with-qodana-and-unity/) -- Archipelago, a virtual reality app that visualizes sales in the form of mountains. Qodana brings all of [Rider's Unity inspections](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Analyzing_Coverage_Unity.html) to CI analysis so the whole team can review code, which was an approach we were very interested in.
