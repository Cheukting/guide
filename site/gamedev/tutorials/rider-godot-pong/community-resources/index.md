While building this game, I found a wealth of great resources everyone should use. I certainly did, and this game would not have been possible without the Godot community.

Here are some great places to seek inspiration and guidance when starting your Godot journey.

- [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/): An excellent documentation site.
- YouTube: I watched hours of excellent tutorials here.
- [Godot Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects): Godot provides samples, and this pong game was ported from the GDScript version.
- [GodotShaders.com](http://godotshaders.com): A great place to find resources to add more spark to your games.
- [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/): A library of guidance with any purchases supporting Godot directly.
- Social Media: I found a lot of great like-minded individuals ready to help.
- [Godot Discord C# channel:](https://discord.com/invite/zH7NUgz) This large community is ready to chat and work through issues with you.

These are a few places I used to learn Godot and continue to use to increase my knowledge. I hope you find these resources as helpful as I did.

### Conclusion

> **[Download JetBrains Rider Pong from GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/jetbrains-rider-godot-pong)**

Who would have thought we’d be at the end of our tutorial? Hopefully, this is only the beginning of your journey with Godot, the game engine that has a bright future. We used the editor to set up a game from a sketch and then methodically went through and implemented those features using JetBrains Rider and C#. We also learned about Godot programming idioms like signals, exports, and nodes. And here we are, with a fully functional pong game, so what’s next?

Feel free to modify the game with your visual style and flair. While I've included the [original repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/jetbrains-rider-godot-pong), [I've also created my own special version](https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/RiderPong) by adding a retro shader. Try changing the images, or the difficulty of the opponent, or making the game a two-player game. The possibilities are endless and only limited by your imagination.
