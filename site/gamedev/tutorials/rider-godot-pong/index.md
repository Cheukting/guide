In this guided tutorial, we’ll build an homage to a classic game—if not the game that started the video game industry—Pong, using the Godot Game Engine and C# written in JetBrains Rider. We’ll delve into the unique features of Godot that make it an excellent engine for game development and explore the benefits of using C# as a compelling scripting language choice.

We will also guide you through setting up your development environment, understanding Godot concepts, and improving your C# and Godot coding techniques. Additionally, we'll provide a helpful list of community resources. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll better understand game development and have a fully functional game that you can confidently share with others, showcasing your newly acquired skills.
