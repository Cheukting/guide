We want to operate on code in the editor fast. Using Cut-and-Paste is kinda fast, but there's a better way that doesn't temporarily remove the code from your file.

Make a selection ([without using the mouse](../make-extend-selection/)) and use <kbd>⌥⇧↑</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+Alt+Up Arrow</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>⌥⇧↓</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+Alt+Down Arrow</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to move that selection to the target line. The selection gets dragged along, in view.

With cut-and-paste, you have semi-dangerously remove your code, then make a new line to put place the selection, then paste.
