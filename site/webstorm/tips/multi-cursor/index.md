Multi-cursor selection in WebStorm:
- Select next occurrence of the current word or selection: _⌃G_ on macOS and _Alt+J_ on Windows and Linux.
- Select all occurrences: _⌃⌘G_ / _Shift+Ctrl+Alt+J_.
- To add or remove multiple carets, you can also press and hold the _⌃_ /_Alt_ key, then click to add a new caret. You can also make a multiple selection by holding _Shift+Alt_ and dragging the caret.
- To remove all the carets, press the _Escape_ key.
