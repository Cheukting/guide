Install the _Randomness_ plugin from _Preferences/Settings | Plugins_ if you're getting stuck coming up with some random data for your project. This plugin allows you to insert random numbers, strings, and UUIDs.

To insert random data, press _Alt+R_ and choose the type of data you want to insert. A different value will be inserted each time you use the action.
