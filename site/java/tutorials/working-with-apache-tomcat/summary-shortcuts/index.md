We've talked about how to set up a new project with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and Tomcat and use Tomcat with an existing application. We've also used the HTTP client available in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts for working with your Tomcat Server:

- You can [run your application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-applications.html) with <kbd>⌃⇧R</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F10</kbd> (Windows/Linux)
- You can [run your application with the debugger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-code.html) with <kbd>⌃D</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+F9</kbd> (Windows/Linux)
- You can [stop your application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-applications.html#stop-pause) with <kbd>⌘F2</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+F2</kbd> (Windows/Linux)
- You can [update your application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/updating-applications-on-application-servers.html) with <kbd>⌘F10</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+F10</kbd> (Windows/Linux)

Alternatively, you can use the buttons to the left of the Services <kbd>⌘8</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+8</kbd> (Windows/Linux) window to work with your Tomcat server.
