Our first tip is to use Presentation Assistant which shows you the shortcuts as you press them. You can configure it in several ways, as we will show you in the section below.

## Configuring the Presentation Assistant plugin

To configure Presentation Assistant, go to you Preferences with <kbd>âŒ˜,</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+S</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and select **Appearance & Behavior | Presentation Assistant**.

Here we can configure font size, duration, alignment, and which keymaps to show. We are using macOS, with Windows as the alternative keymap. We have also configured the Presentation Assistant plugin to show the shortcuts at the top of the screen. This is what we recommend if you are recording videos that will have subtitles at the bottom, so the subtitles and shortcuts won't overlap.
