When presenting, you can use **Presentation Mode**. The IDE switches to full screen and everything is hidden except for the main editor window. The font size is increased, so it is easier to read from a distance.

You can switch to Presentation Mode by clicking **View | Appearance | Enter Presentation Mode**.

Similarly, exit Presentation Mode by clicking **View | Appearance | Exit Presentation Mode**.

If needed, the font size in Presentation Mode can be configured in **Preferences | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance**. Scroll down to **Presentation Mode**, and font size and set the font size you want. Click **OK** to apply the changes and close the dialog or click **Apply** to keep the dialog open. Click **Cancel** to discard the changes and close the dialog.

We can also open Presentation Mode using short-cuts. Open the **Quick Switch Scheme** using <kbd>âŒƒ\`</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+\`</kbd> (Windows/Linux)
. Use the arrows to select **View Mode** and then select **Enter Presentation Mode**.

You can use **Quick Switch Scheme** again to **Exit Presentation Mode** in the same way.
