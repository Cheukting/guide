## Moving Content Up or Down in Your Class

With your caret on a line, you can press <kbd>⌥⇧↑</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up Arrow</kbd> (Windows/Linux), to move a line up. Alternatively, you can move a line down with <kbd>⌥⇧↓</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Down Arrow</kbd> (Windows/Linux). The same shortcut can move a selection up or down.

This does not account for scope. That means you can easily break your code by moving a line outside its scope so be careful! IntelliJ IDEA will move the whole paragraph if you're working with something like markdown.
