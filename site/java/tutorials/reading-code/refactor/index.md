While trying to understand the code, you may want to perform small refactorings, like renaming a variable or method using **Refactor | Rename** <kbd>⇧F6</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+F6</kbd> (Windows/Linux), **Extract Method** using <kbd>⌥⌘M</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to extract a method and giving it a meaningful name, or refactoring the code to a style you are more familiar with to make it easier for you to read and understand the code, for example using **Intention Actions** <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux). Playing with the code can help you verify your assumptions and improve your understanding. Remember though, that these changes are not meant to be committed. Revert them when you’re done!
