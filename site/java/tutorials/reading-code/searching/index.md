We can search the code for specific names of variables, methods, or Strings, for example a log message. IntelliJ IDEA will highlight the results of your search in the file.
We can also search for other occurrences from the editor. For example, we can select this variable name, and press <kbd>âŒ˜F</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to search for the selected string. IntelliJ IDEA will place the selected string into the search field and highlight all occurrences in the file.
