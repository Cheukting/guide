Reformat your file, or part of your file, at any time with **⌘⌥L** (on macOS), or **Ctrl+Alt+L** (on Windows/Linux) according to your code style settings.
To remove custom line breaks, reformat the file or code again.

Display the **Reformat File** dialog with **⌥⇧⌘L** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L** (Windows/Linux). In this dialog, we can select the scope we want to apply; either the whole file, or only changes that haven't been committed to VCS yet.

We can select a piece of code and use **Context Actions** (**⌥⏎** on macOS, or **Alt+Enter** on Windows/Linux) to open the dialog to **Adjust code style settings**.
