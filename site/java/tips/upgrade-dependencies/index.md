Manage your dependencies inside IntelliJ IDEA. Use intention actions <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to upgrade dependencies right inside your IDE when there are new versions available.
To use this feature, make sure the [Package Search](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/package-search.html) plugin is enabled.
