The fastest way to move around the IDE is with the keyboard. Most tool windows have a simple numeric shortcut, for example the _Project_ tool window is <kbd>âŒ˜1</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+1</kbd> (Windows/Linux). For those that don't have a keyboard shortcut, you can open these by using [Find Action](/tips/find-action), or [Search Everywhere](/tips/search-everywhere).

Don't forget, you can easily search any dialog or window in IntelliJ IDEA simply by typing the thing you want to search for.
