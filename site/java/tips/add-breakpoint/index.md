When you run your code and get an unhandled exception, you can click **Create breakpoint** in the _Run_ window to add a breakpoint to your code. In the **Breakpoints** popup, set the desired configuration for your breakpoint and click **Done**. Debug your code using the shortcut <kbd>‚åÉD</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+F9</kbd> (Windows/Linux). Code execution will stop at the breakpoint, and you can examine the state of your application in the _Debug_ tool window.
