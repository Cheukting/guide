You can filter dialogs in IntelliJ IDEA by typing your search directly in. For example, you can filter the Recent Files dialog - <kbd>⌘⇧E</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> (Windows/Linux) - to just the Maven Window, or you can filter the Project window - <kbd>⌘1</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+1</kbd> (Windows/Linux) - to find a file.

Try searching in any dialog in IntelliJ IDEA to filter your results to just the ones you're interested in.
