You can add a background photo by using <kbd>⌘⇧A</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+A</kbd> (Windows/Linux) for Find Actions and then typing in _background image_. Navigate to the image you want to display and click **OK**. You can use Find Actions again to change the opacity of the image, change it or remove it completely.
