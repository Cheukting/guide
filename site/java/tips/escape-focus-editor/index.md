Pressing <kbd>␛</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Escape</kbd> (Windows/Linux) will dismiss the current dialog if there's one open and return your focus to the editor. If you open a tool window such as the Project Window and then press <kbd>␛</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Escape</kbd> (Windows/Linux), IntelliJ IDEA will return the focus to your editor but leave the _Project_ tool window open.
