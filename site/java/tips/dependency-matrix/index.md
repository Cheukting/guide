Use the Dependency Matrix to visualize dependencies between components in your projects.

As you can see in the legend at the top right of the _DSM_ tool window:

- dependencies are shown in blue
- mutual or cyclic dependencies, meaning that two components depend on each other, are shown in red
- dependencies flow from green to yellow
