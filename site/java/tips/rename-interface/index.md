Press <kbd>⇧F6</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+F6</kbd> (Windows/Linux), to rename anything in IntelliJ IDEA, including interfaces. Everything that uses that interface will also be renamed.

**Pro tip:**

You can use <kbd>⌥⇧O</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Shift+O</kbd> (Windows/Linux), to expand the inlay hints to also consider Comments and Text.
