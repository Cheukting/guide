Sealed classes (first preview feature in Java 16) are a way to take control of the inheritance hierarchy of our classes. IntelliJ IDEA can let us know about problems in the classes that extend sealed classes, and suggest solutions.

Experiment with Sealed Types, use <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to see and accept suggestions.
