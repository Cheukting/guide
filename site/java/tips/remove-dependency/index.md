Manage your dependencies inside IntelliJ IDEA. Remove unused dependencies with the click of a button!
Open the _Dependencies_ tool window to find the dependency you're looking for. Select the dependency you want to remove, click the three dots on the top right of the _Dependency details_ pane, and click **Remove**.
To use this feature, make sure the [Package Search](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/package-search.html) plugin is enabled.
