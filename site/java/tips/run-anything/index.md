Run anything (**⌃⌃** on macOS), or **Ctrl+Ctrl** on Windows/Linux) allows you to run any of your **Run Configurations** as well as scripts and commands such as `mvn clean` or `gradle --status`. You can also use Run Anything to open your recent projects. Press **?** to see the available options and then run Maven Goals, Gradle Tasks, Open a Project or Run an existing run configuration.
