Data Flow Analysis is a powerful tool that shows you how data moves through your code. It can locate places where we could have errors in our code. For example, if we use a negative number for initialising an array, or checking for negative values where the value couldn't be negative.
Use **Code | Analyze Code | Data Flow to Here** or **Code | Analyze Code | Data Flow from Here** to analyze upstream or downstream data flow\*\*.
