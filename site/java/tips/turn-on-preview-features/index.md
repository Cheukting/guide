If you want to use preview features in the latest versions of Java in IntelliJ IDEA, you need to set the language level to _Preview_.

Go to Project Structure, <kbd>âŒ˜;</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S</kbd> (Windows/Linux), make sure you have the correct JDK selected, and pick the "Preview" option from the Language Level dropdown.
