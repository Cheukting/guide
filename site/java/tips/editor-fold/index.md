You can select some code by scope and then use <kbd>⌥⌘T</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+T</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to create an editor fold.

Fold code <kbd>⌥⌘-</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+-</kbd> (Windows/Linux) when you don't need it, and expand it again <kbd>⌥⌘+</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt++</kbd> (Windows/Linux) when you do.

These are useful to minimise some code while you're working in other areas of the class. You can always maximise them again later.
