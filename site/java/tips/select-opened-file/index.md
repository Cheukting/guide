You found the thing you were looking for in the code base, but where is this file located? Use the **Select Opened File** icon in the **Project tool window** to find the file in the project structure, or use the **Select In** action <kbd>‚å•F1</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+F1</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and press **1** for the **Project tool window**.
