Sometimes, you want to know why certain code was changed or what happened in a particular commit. You can find the commit in the **Git** tool window, and look at the commit message and the changes in the file yourself. Or you can ask AI Assistant to explain the commit to you.
If you have an active AI Assistant subscription, you will find this action in the context menu. Right-click the commit you need more information on, and select **Explain Commit with AI Assistant** from the context menu. AI Assistant will open a new chat with a predefined prompt and explain this commit to you.
