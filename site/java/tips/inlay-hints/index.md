Inlay hints are special markers that provide additional information about your code, like parameter names, annotations, usages, and so on. They appear in light gray text and are highly configurable. Open **Settings** and go to **Editor | Inlay Hints** if you want to make any changes to which inlay hints are shown in the editor.
