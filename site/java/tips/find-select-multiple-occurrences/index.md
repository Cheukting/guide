Place your caret on the word or text range you want to find and select multiple occurrences of and then use <kbd>⌘⌃G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to find and select the next occurrence of the word. This is a case-sensitive search. You can use <kbd>⌘⌃G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J</kbd> to select all matching words in the document rather than selecting one at a time. You can use <kbd>^⇧G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Shift+J</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to remove the selection from the last selected occurrence. To skip an occurrence, use <kbd>⌘G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>F3</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and to go back to the last selected occurrence, use **⇧⌘G** (macOS), or **Shift+F3** (Windows/Linux).
