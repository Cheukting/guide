Right-click the branch in the _Git_ log window and select **Show Diff with Working Tree** from the context menu. This will show the changes between the selected branch and the current branch in a tree view. Here you can **Swap branches**, or change the view using **Group By** to group by either **Directory** or **Module**, and either **Expand All** or **Collapse all**.
