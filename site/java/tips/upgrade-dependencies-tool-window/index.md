Manage your dependencies inside IntelliJ IDEA. Open the _Dependencies_ tool window to manage your dependencies. There are multiple ways to open the Dependencies tool window, including:

- Open all windows from **Recent Files** <kbd>⌘E</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+E</kbd> (Windows/Linux)
- Use **Search Everywhere** <kbd>⇧⇧</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+Shift</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to search for "Dependencies"
- Use **Find Action** <kbd>⌘⇧A</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+A</kbd> to search for "Dependencies"

From the _Dependencies_ tool window you can upgrade an individual dependency, or all dependencies at once, right in your IDE when there are new versions available, by clicking the link to **Upgrade** (a single dependency) or **Upgrade (all)** (to upgrade all dependencies at once).

To use this feature, make sure the [Package Search](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/package-search.html) plugin is enabled.
