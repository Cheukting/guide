Manage your dependencies inside IntelliJ IDEA. Open the **Dependencies tool window** to manage your dependencies. There are multiple ways to open the Dependencies tool window, including:

- Open all windows from **Recent Files** (**⌘E** on macOS, or **Ctrl+E** on Windows/Linux)
- Use **Search Everywhere** (**⇧⇧**) to search for "Dependencies"
- Use **Find Action** (**⌘⇧A** on macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+A** on Windows/Linux) to search for "Dependencies"

From the **Dependencies tool window** you can upgrade an individual dependency, or all dependencies at once, right in your IDE when there are new versions available, by clicking the link to **Upgrade** (a single dependency) or **Upgrade (all)** (to upgrade all dependencies at once).
