Access the **Productivity Guide** from the **Help** menu, or use Find Action (**⇧⌘A** on macOS, or **Control+Shift+A** on Windows/Linux) and search for "productivity", to see the functionality that you're using and how often, as well as the functionality you might not have tried out. What will you learn next?
