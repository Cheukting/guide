Manage dependencies inside your IDE. Manage your dependencies with #IntelliJIDEA Package Search. Upgrade one, or all, dependencies right in your IDE when there are new versions available.
To use this feature, make sure the [Package Search](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/package-search.html) plugin is enabled.
