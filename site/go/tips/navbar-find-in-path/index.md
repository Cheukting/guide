_Need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow?_

Closed the _Project_ tool window and need to find a file somewhere in the project tree?

**How to use:**

Activate the _Navigation Bar_, <kbd>⌘↑</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Home</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

Then navigate to the target, and use _Find in Path_, <kbd>⌘⇧F</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F</kbd> (Windows/Linux), from the keyboard.
