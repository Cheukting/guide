_Need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow?_

Closed the _Project Tool Window_ and need to find a file somewhere in the project tree?

**How to use:**

Activate the **Navigation Bar**, <kbd>⌘↑</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Home</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

Then navigate to the target, and use **Find in Path**, <kbd>⌘⇧F</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F</kbd> (Windows/Linux), from the keyboard.
