Code coverage enables you to see exactly what parts of your code are executed during single or multiple runs. It's an invaluable asset for detecting dead code, ensuring that every line of your code serves a purpose.

- Detailed Execution Insights: track which parts of your code are being used and which are not during execution.
- Dead Code Detection: easily identify and remove code that is never executed, streamlining your application.
