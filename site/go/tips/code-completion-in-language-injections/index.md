GoLand provides code completion and analysis in injected strings for _SQL_ and _databases statements_, _JavaScript_, _CSS_, _HTML_, _XML_, and _RegExp_, etc.

Place the cursor within the literal (_between_ the quotation marks) and press <kbd>⌃⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux), select **Inject language or reference**, choose which one of supported injection language you want to use and start typing, auto-completion will appear instantly.
