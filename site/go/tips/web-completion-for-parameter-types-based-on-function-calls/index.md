The IDE will show you completion suggestions based on the type used in the function call for the parameters in the function body.

You don't need to do anything to use this feature as the IDE will automatically infer the code suggestions based on what you typed already.

**Pro tip:** Use the Smart Type Completion, <kbd>⌃⇧␣</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Space</kbd> (Windows/Linux), to narrow-down the list further.
