Multiple selections is a very powerful feature in the editor, that lets you quickly select and edit multiple pieces of code at once.

**How to use:**

Select something as you normally would, or press <kbd>^G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+J</kbd> (Windows/Linux), to select the symbol at the caret.

GoLand will search through the current file until it finds a matching piece of text, which it then adds to the selection.

You can press <kbd>^G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+J</kbd> (Windows/Linux) again to go forward further, or <kbd>^â‡§G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Shift+J</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to go backward. When the search reaches the end of the file, it will start over again from the beginning.
