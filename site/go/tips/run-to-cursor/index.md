Instead of stepping through the code line by line after pausing, you might decide that you want the program to continue running until it reaches a specific point in the code where you've placed the cursor. This is where "Run to cursor" (<kbd>‚å•
Opt F9</kbd>) in macOS or (<kbd>Alt + F9</kbd>) in Windows/Linux comes in handy.
