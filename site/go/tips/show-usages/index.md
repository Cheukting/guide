The **Show usages** feature allows you to quickly answer the question "Where's this element used?"

It will open a pop-up that you can quickly use to navigate/filter or otherwise dismiss with the results you are looking for.

**How to use:**

Press <kbd>⌥⌘F7</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+F7</kbd> (Windows/Linux).
