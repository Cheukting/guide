**How to use:**

Open any JS file and start using any Vue.js 3 related code. The IDE will provide you assistance with code completion, refactoring, find usages, and more.

**Note:** You must install the [_Vue.js_](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9442-vue-js) support plugin from the IDE Marketplace via **Settings/Preferences | Plugins | Marketplace** for this functionality to work.
