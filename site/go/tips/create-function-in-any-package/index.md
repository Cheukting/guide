GoLand introduces an innovative feature: the **Create Function Quick-Fix**. This quick-fix significantly accelerates the development process by allowing you to type a non-existing function name and then effortlessly generate its implementation in a package of your choice.

**How it Works:**

Start by typing the name of a function that does not yet exist in your code. Click a light bulb icon that appears in the editor or use the keyboard shortcut (`Alt + Enter` on Windows/Linux, `⌥ + ⏎` on macOS) to activate the quick-fix. Select the package where you want to generate the new function.
