GoLand introduces an innovative feature: the _Create Function Quick-Fix_. This quick-fix significantly accelerates the development process by allowing you to type a non-existing function name and then effortlessly generate its implementation in a package of your choice.

Start by typing the name of a function that does not yet exist in your code. Click a light bulb icon that appears in the editor or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to activate the quick-fix. Select the package where you want to generate the new function.
