The IDE can automatically reload the page opened in a browser after you make changes to an HTML file, or the linked CSS and JavaScript files.

**How to use:**

First, open the file from the IDE via the icon on the upper right-side of the editor or via _View | Open in Browser | <browser name>_.

Reloading is triggered whenever changes are saved in the IDE, either automatically or using Press <kbd>âŒ˜S</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or when changes are made to a file externally.
