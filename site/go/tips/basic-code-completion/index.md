_Basic completion_ provides a list of _all symbols_ available at the current caret position.

The list will include the usual mix of type, interface, and method names, keywords, and also _Live Templates_.

_Symbols from not-yet-imported packages_ are also offered, with autoimport on-the-fly when you select them.

**How to use:**

Basic completion pops up as you start typing code and GoLand recognizes an opportunity to complete something for you, but you can invoke it anytime by pressing <kbd>⌃␣</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

**Pro tip:**

_Basic Code Completion_ is also available for non-English symbols.
