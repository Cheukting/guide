**How to use:**

Expand the Kubernetes cluster in which the pod resides, then the _Workloads | Pods_ section, select the pod that you need the log for, then right-click on the pod name and select _Download Log_.

**Note:** You must have the [Kubernetes plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10485-kubernetes) provided by JetBrains installed for this action to work.
