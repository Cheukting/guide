The _Navigation Bar_ has a useful feature that can help you get an overview of both your current location and the structure of the project itself.

**How to use:**

Press <kbd>⌘↑</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Home</kbd> (Windows/Linux), and it will appear.

Use the Arrow keys to move around inside and press <kbd>⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to enter a certain folder or <kbd>␛</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Escape</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to exit from it.

**Pro tip:**

_Speed Search_ is available here and it will help you quickly filter the files in your view.
