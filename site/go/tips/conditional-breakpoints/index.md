_Stop stepping._

Have a breakpoint in a loop and find yourself clicking **Continue**
repeatedly? Change your breakpoint to only stop when a condition is met.

**How to use:**

Edit the breakpoint properties via <kbd>⌘⇧F8</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F8 (Windows/Linux)</kbd>, then type in the **Condition** you want.
