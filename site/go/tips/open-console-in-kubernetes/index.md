**How to use:**

Select the pod you want from the _Kubernetes_ view in the _Services_ tool window, then click on **Open Console**. A new tab will open and a console will be attached to the running process inside the pod.

**Note:** You must have the [Kubernetes plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10485-kubernetes) provided by JetBrains installed for this action to work.
