The **File Structure** popup window allows you to get an overview of all the elements defined in a file or a package.

You can use it to navigate to any definition and invoke it from anywhere.

**How to use:**

Use <kbd>⌘F12</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+F12</kbd> (Windows/Linux), and a window with all the elements defined in the current file will show up.

**Pro tip:**

Press <kbd>⌘F12</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+F12</kbd> (Windows/Linux), again with the window still open, and it will show all the elements defined in the package of the current file.

_Speed Typing_ can then help you to narrow down the list of elements to the one that you need.
