If you have an anonymous type defined, you can extract it into a
standalone type and reuse it across your code.

**How to use:**
Invoke **Refactor this** with <kbd>^T</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T</kbd> (Windows/Linux), on the anonymous type, then select the **Extract type** from the list of available refactorings.

Give it a name and start reusing the newly created type in your code.
