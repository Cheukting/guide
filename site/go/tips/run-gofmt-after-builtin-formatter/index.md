Make sure your code is always formatted with gofmt.

**How to use:**

To use this feature, check the **On code reformat** option under _Settings/Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Go | Other_.

Now you can use the default shortcut, <kbd>⌘⌥L</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+L</kbd> (Windows/Linux), to trigger the builtin formatter.

**Pro tip**: You can also search for **Run gofmt** in the IDE _Settings/Preferences_, and activate the option as described above.
