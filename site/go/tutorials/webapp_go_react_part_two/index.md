Go, Gin, and React are potent tools for building full-stack web apps. The [first part of this series](../webapp_go_react_part_one/) dived into setting up a backend application using Go and Gin. You learned how to create the basic building blocks of a chat application, including endpoints for users, channels, and messages.

This second part of the series focuses on the application's frontend. You'll learn how to create a React frontend that communicates with your Gin-powered backend. Moreover, you'll leverage Tailwind CSS to ensure your chat application looks good. Along the way, you'll learn how GoLand's IDE capabilities can simplify your development process.
