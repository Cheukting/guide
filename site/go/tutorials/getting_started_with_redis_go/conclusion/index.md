Redis is a popular in-memory database, caching service, and messaging system. In this tutorial, you learned how to use Go and the GoLand IDE to quickly set up a Redis project, connect to a Redis server, and run various operations like reading and writing string values, hashes, and sets. You also learned about using pipelines and transactions to your advantage and using pub-sub messaging.
