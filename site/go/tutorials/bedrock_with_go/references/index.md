## Source Code

You can access the backend source code written in Go through this [link](https://github.com/mukulmantosh/goapp_genai), and for the frontend UI in React, click [here](https://github.com/mukulmantosh/bedrock_ui).

I want to thank [Abhishek Gupta](https://community.aws/@abhishekgupta) for his outstanding content on getting started with AWS Bedrock. His code examples were incredibly useful for setting up this tutorial.
