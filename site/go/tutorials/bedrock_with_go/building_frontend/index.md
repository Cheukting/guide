> Before we proceed, I want to mention that this section of the tutorial is entirely optional. We'll be developing our application using React, so it's assumed that you have some familiarity with it, as we won't be covering it in detail. Developing in React is not mandatory; you can choose whether to use it or implement these concepts with the framework you prefer.
