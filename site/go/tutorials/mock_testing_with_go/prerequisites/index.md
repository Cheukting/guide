## Getting Started with Mock Testing in Go and GoLand

This tutorial demonstrates mocking techniques on a sample project. For best results, keep this project open in a Go IDE while reading through the tutorial. That way, you can run the examples immediately and learn from first-hand experience.

### Prerequisites

It only takes a few steps to get started:

- Ensure you have the latest version (or at least a fairly recent version) of [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed.
- Download and install the [GoLand IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download). There is a free trial available; if you are new to GoLand, don't miss the chance to test it out!
- Fork or clone the [code repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/go-code-samples) for this tutorial. For brevity, this tutorial shows only parts of the code, so be sure to have the repository available to follow along.
