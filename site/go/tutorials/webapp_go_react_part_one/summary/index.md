## Summary and Next Steps

You now have a complete, working backend for your group chat application. Along the way, you've learned how to use GoLand to create a new Go project, how to use SQLite in Go, and how to create a backend API using Gin.

You can find the final backend for this part of the series in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rpeden/go-gin-react-part1).

In the next part of the series, you'll learn how to test your app's Gin endpoints and create a React UI that connects to the backend and lets users log in, create channels, and participate in group chats.
