To work with the code used in this guide, you can use an IDE of your choice or install the [GoLand IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download). There is a free trial available; if you are new to GoLand, this is a great chance to test it out!

Then, fork or clone the [repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/go-code-samples) that contains the code for this guide.

The repository contains code samples from articles published on the GoLand blog. The code for this guide resides in the directory `error-handling`.

Follow these steps to open the code in GoLand:

1. Start GoLand.
2. If it's a fresh installation, you'll be prompted with a welcome screen. Click the **Open** button.
3. In the file selector dialog that opens, navigate to the repository you cloned earlier, select the folder `error-handling`, and click **Open**.

And you're set! Keep the IDE within reach while following the guide.
