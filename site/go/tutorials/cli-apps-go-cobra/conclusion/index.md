Congratulations! You've successfully developed a command line application to execute basic mathematical operations using the Cobra package and the Go programming language. This practical journey encompassed commands, subcommands, flags, and effective error handling. You also learned how to prepare your application for deployment and distribution by generating and installing a shareable binary format. With this knowledge, you can start creating and deploying your own command line tools.

You can find the entire codebase for the article in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/IzyPro/Zero).

Happy coding!
