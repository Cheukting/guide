Command line interface (CLI) applications facilitate interactions between users and a computer via text-based commands entered into a terminal or command prompt. These applications are also known as console applications or command line programs. When users enter a predefined command, the application performs the specific task associated with that command, often displaying text-based results as output.

In this article, you'll learn more about the command line, its concepts, and how to build a command line application with the Go programming language using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), a simple and powerful open source library for creating modern command line applications.
