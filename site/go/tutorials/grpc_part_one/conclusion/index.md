gRPC APIs are a robust improvement over traditional REST APIs. With gRPC, a client can invoke a procedure on the server just like a local procedure. In the first part of this series, you learned how to write a Protobuf definition and how to generate Go code from it. You also used the `grpc-gateway` plugin to generate a reverse proxy for REST clients.

In the [next part](../../grpc_part_two/), you'll start writing the gRPC server.
