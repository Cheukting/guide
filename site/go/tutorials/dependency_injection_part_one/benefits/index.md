### Benefits

Using DI in software engineering provides several benefits, some of which include the following:

- **Loose coupling:** DI ensures that software components are loosely coupled and highly flexible since objects depend on abstractions as opposed to concrete implementations. This allows for easier maintenance, testing, and refactoring, as these dependencies can be easily swapped or modified without impacting the dependent object.
- **Enhanced testability:** By injecting dependencies, it becomes easier to substitute real objects with mock or test doubles during unit or integration tests. This means that instead of using the actual dependencies, you can provide alternative implementations that simulate the behavior of the real dependencies, which can then be used for testing.
- **Flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability:** DI allows for much more flexible, extensible, and maintainable code. New functionalities can be added by simply introducing new dependencies and injecting them. This makes it easier to introduce changes without modifying existing code and running the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Modularity and reusability:** Naturally, DI promotes clarity by breaking down applications into smaller independent modules and components. Each component has its own defined dependencies, making them usable in any context. This modularity and separation of components also promote code organization, separation of concerns, and overall codebase flexibility.
- **Runtime configuration:** Implementing dependency creation and management externally allows you to configure and switch dependencies based on different runtime conditions.

Overall, DI promotes good software design and enhances the overall quality of your application in terms of testability, modularity, maintainability, and flexibility.

## Drawbacks

While DI offers numerous benefits, it's important to also consider the potential drawbacks:

- **Increased complexity:** Implementing DI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to your codebase. The need to define dependencies, manage their lifecycles, and configure the injection can make the code harder to understand.
- **Performance overhead:** DI can introduce some level of performance overhead due to the dynamic resolution of dependencies at runtime. Although modern DI frameworks and toolkits are optimized for efficiency, there can still be a [slight impact](https://github.com/stefanoschrs/go-fx-test#benchmarks) on the application performance.
- **Increased learning curve:** Adopting DI requires developers to understand its concepts, principles, and recommended practices. This might come with some initial time overhead and potentially limit development at first as a result of the learning curve. In addition, developers must be wary of pitfalls such as circular dependency, which occurs when two classes depend on each other.
- **Runtime errors:** Improper or unresolved dependencies can lead to unexpected behavior, application crashes, or errors at runtime. These errors can sometimes be challenging to troubleshoot, particularly in large codebases with complex dependency graphs.

Although DI is highly recommended, it's important to consider these drawbacks in the context of your specific project requirements and constraints.
