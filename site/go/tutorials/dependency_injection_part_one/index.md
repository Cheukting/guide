Dependency injection (DI) is a software development technique that revolves around providing dependencies to an object from external sources rather than creating them within the object itself. It can also be simplified as a programming pattern in which an object receives other objects that it depends on to function. This is based on the [inversion of control (IoC) principle](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/ioc/inversion-of-control) of software engineering.

This article delves into the world of DI in Go, exploring its numerous benefits and potential drawbacks. Additionally, it explores popular approaches and toolkits utilized in implementing dependency injection in Go, empowering developers to effectively leverage this technique.
