Full-stack programming has been popular for years. Three-tier architecture: database, application server, UI.
More recently, backends have delegated the UI tier to "frontends", and thus was born REST API programming.

Want to get started in REST API development for Go? In this tutorial, we'll get started with all the major pieces:

- Databases
- Driven with ORM
- JSON
- HTTP

All of these topics will be shown with an emphasis on how the IDE -- GoLand -- can help.
