In this last installment, you'll connect the dots. You'll start by setting up a proxy to let your React frontend communicate with the Go and Gin backend during development. Then, you'll run the app and explore various user flows such as account creation, login, channel creation, and messaging. Finally, you'll gear up for deployment by creating production builds and configuring the Gin backend to serve your app's UI.

Time to put the finishing touches on your full-stack web app!
