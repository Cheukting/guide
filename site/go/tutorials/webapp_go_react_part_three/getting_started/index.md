In this last installment, you'll connect the dots. You'll start by setting up a proxy to let your React frontend communicate with the Go and Gin backend during development. Then, you'll run the app and explore various user flows such as account creation, login, channel creation, and messaging. Finally, you'll gear up for deployment by creating production builds and configuring the Gin backend to serve your app's UI.

Time to put the finishing touches on your full-stack web app!

## Getting the Code

If you've worked your way through the first two parts of the series, you can use the code you already created. Otherwise, you can use the [code from part two](https://github.com/rpeden/go-gin-react-part2) as a starting point.

You can also find the final, complete chat app in [this repository](https://github.com/rpeden/go-gin-react-part3).

If you choose to clone one of the repositories, open it in GoLand by clicking the **Open** button on the welcome screen:

Then, open the directory where you cloned the GitHub repository.
