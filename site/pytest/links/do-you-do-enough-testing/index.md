Webinar with **Brian Okken**, **Paul Everitt** and **Helen Scott**.

We’ll be chatting with Brian Okken about all things pytest, including some live coding examples. In addition, we’ll be talking about his latest [pytest course](https://courses.pythontest.com/), which he created to help people learn how to use the Python testing tool. Regardless of your pytest experience or preferred learning style, this webinar has something for everyone!

In this webinar, Brian covers various topics related to testing, including parameterization, fixtures, and built-in fixtures. He emphasizes the importance of writing well-structured and readable tests and highlights the use of pytest fixtures to simplify testing. Brian explains that fixtures are functions that can be used to set up the necessary conditions for a test. He demonstrates how fixtures can be used to simplify tests, improve readability, and handle common testing needs, such as mocking and managing files. He also mentions that Pytest provides built-in fixtures for common testing tasks, such as capturing output and creating temporary files.

Throughout the webinar, Brian shares practical examples and explains how to use pytest effectively. He encourages developers to learn pytest and start writing tests early in the development process. He also provides resources, such as his book and course, to help developers dive deeper into testing with pytest. Overall, the webinar provides valuable insights into testing with pytest, emphasizing the importance of well-structured and readable tests and showcasing pytest's powerful features.
