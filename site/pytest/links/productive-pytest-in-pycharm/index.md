**Guest: Brian Okken**

Brian is also the author of Python Testing with pytest and has recently launched [his new pytest course](https://courses.pythontest.com/). Mostly, he spends his free time telling people they should write good, clean automated tests, specifically using pytest.

Brian shows:

- Good style for asserts
- Refactoring verbose tests into fixtures and conftest.py files
- Refactoring fixtures
- Using parameterize to repeat similar tests
- Other uses of markers
- Coverage
- Good TDD style

Along the way, Brian will use the productive PyCharm testing features from the first webinar.
