Do you want to be a pro at testing with pytest? If so, this video tutorial is for you! We will start at the beginning of the universe and leave no stone unturned in our quest for pytest mastery!

- Setup
For starters, setup files are so last decade! I’ll show you how to set up your pyproject.toml file using pytests best practices.

- Running tests
We’re all different so I’ll show you how you can run your tests so you can choose what works for you. Use your gutter icons to run tests, your right-click context menus, or your trusty keyboard shortcuts.

- Test Driven Development
I’m going to throw some TDD into the mix so you can try it and see if it works for you. We’ll see how we can test and code simultaneously and craft our code to get to a passing test - victory!

- Skipping Tests
Let’s talk about the dirty little secret in the room - skipping tests. Sometimes you need to skip a test, you’re the boss! We’ll dive into this use case and how to skip tests when a certain condition is true, or not. Now we’ve annotated the test as skipped, when we re-run all our tests, we can easily see which ones passed and which ones were skipped.

- Raising Exceptions
It’s all very well wanting throwing your weight, or exceptions around, but how about checking that they’re being thrown correctly? I’ll show you how to do this in pytest and check that the exception you expected to throw really does get thrown. It’s not that one… it’s this one!

- Fixtures
It’s good to be lazy, we don’t want to duplicate effort... right? We’ll take a little tour into the world of fixtures and how you can use them to create code which is setup once and used by some, or even all, of your tests.

- Debugging tests
The debugger is your friend regardless of where you are in your coding workflow, I’m going to get you comfortable with it so you can be more confident in your code. I will take you treasure hunting with the debugger so we can poke around in the code and look at the the benefits of using the debugger when we’re writing our tests.
