The core idea of Django is to let developers build their applications quickly. When you master this framework, the path from concept to production-ready web application will be a short one. However, if you want to go even faster, you can learn to create Django apps in PyCharm.

This tutorial will guide you through all the steps to create a simple Django application that shows the current air temperature at your location. To bring in some interactivity, the app also lets you browse weather conditions at other random locations.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Create a Django project in PyCharm.
- Write models, views, and templates.
- Make API calls and process responses.
- Connect to databases and fill them with data.
