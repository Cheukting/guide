As a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, Jan-Niklas Wortmann isn't just another coderâ€”he's a code evangelist. With TypeScript as his weapon of choice, he's on a mission to make your dev life easier, one line at a time. Angular geek? He's got you covered. Obsessed with reactive programming? So is he. Outside of fine-tuning the developer experience at JetBrains, Jan is a Google Developer Expert for Angular and a part of the RxJS Core Team.
