## The Problem

Do you need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow? Perhaps you've closed the Project tool window and need to find a file somewhere in the project tree?

## The Solution

You can invoke **Navigate | Jump to Navigation Bar** <kbd>⌘↑</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Home</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to temporarily re-activate the Navigation Bar. Once you use it, the window disappears.

Navigate to the target, and invoke "Find in Path", <kbd>⌘⇧F</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F</kbd> (Windows/Linux), from the keyboard.
