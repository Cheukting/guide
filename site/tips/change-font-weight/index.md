You can change the font weights for your code. In settings or preferences, <kbd>âŒ˜,</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+S</kbd> (Windows/Linux), go to Editor -> Font. Open the section **Typography Settings**, choose a different weight for the main code, and for the bolder sections.
If the font you are using has ligatures, you can **Enable ligatures** here.
There's a preview area on the right, so you can see the effect of your changes. Click **Revert changes** if you want to undo the changes you made.
