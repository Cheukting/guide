**How to use:**

Open any CSS file and start typing either _@tailwind_ directives or CSS statements such as _@apply font-bold bg-blue-400;_

**Note:** You must install the [_Tailwind CSS_](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15321-tailwind-css) support plugin from the IDE Marketplace via _Settings/Preferences | Plugins | Marketplace_ for this functionality to work.
