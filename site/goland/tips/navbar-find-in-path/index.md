*Need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow?*

Closed the *Project Tool Window* and need to find a file somewhere in the project tree?

**How to use:**

Activate the **Navigation Bar**, *Alt + Home on Windows/Linux* or *⌘ + ↑ on macOS*.

Then navigate to the target, and use **Find in Path**, *Ctrl + Shift + F on Windows/Linux*
or *⌘ + ⇧ + F on macOS*, from the keyboard.
