*Stop stepping.*

Have a breakpoint in a loop and find yourself clicking **Continue**
repeatedly? Change your breakpoint to only stop when a condition is met.

**How to use:**

Edit the breakpoint properties via *Ctrl + Shift + F8 on Windows/Linux*,
or *⇧ + ⌘ + F8 on macOS*, then type in the **Condition** you want.
