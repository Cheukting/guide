Need to change the case of struct tag keys?

Choose between *snake_case*, *(lower) camelCase*,
*(upper) CamelCase*, or *kebap-case* and apply this to the whole
struct in a few steps.

**How to use:**

Place the cursor on a struct field, then invoke the
*Context Actions* menu via *Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux*
or *⌥ + ⏎ on macOS*.

Select the *Change field name style in tags*, and choose
between one of the four styles available.

<span class="tag is-rounded">New in 2021.1</span>
