We’ve just released [AI Assistant for IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ai-assistant.html), which can help you complete many tasks in the IDE, such as explaining code, generating commits, and assisting with writing code. The AI Assistant plugin is powered by the JetBrains AI Service, which uses different large language models (LLMs) under the hood and enables specific AI-powered features within many JetBrains products.

Since we like dogfooding, I decided to try out AI Assistant in IntelliJ IDEA to write a new Java inspection for IntelliJ IDEA, and write down my experience while solving this task. Let’s take a look!
