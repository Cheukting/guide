Hello, enthusiastic web creators!

Testing is imperative in the world of software development, as it ensures our code is working as expected. However, writing tests by hand can be tedious, and we often postpone doing it or sometimes skip the process altogether, especially when deadlines are looming.

According to the recent JetBrains DevEcosystem survey, 31% of PHP developers don’t write tests. Could this be due to the perception of testing as a complex and daunting task? Nevertheless, it’s no longer an issue thanks to JetBrains AI Assistant.
