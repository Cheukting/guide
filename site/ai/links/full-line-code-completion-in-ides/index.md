Python, JavaScript, CSS, and more. The feature is deeply integrated into JetBrains IDEs, providing suggestions that are correctly formatted and filtered based on code correctness checks. It aims to enhance workflow efficiency by avoiding suggestions that are often canceled or deleted.

The full line code completion feature is different from JetBrains AI Assistant, as it focuses solely on code completion, whereas the AI Assistant offers a wider range of functionalities. The suggestions generated by the full line code completion are based on programming-language specific language models, which are trained using open-source code. Users can configure the feature in the IDE settings.
