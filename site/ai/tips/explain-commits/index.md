You can use JetBrains AI Assistant to summarise one or more commits from the _Git_ (or other VCS) tool window. Open the tool window with <kbd>âŒ˜9</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+9</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and select one more commits that you would like to ask AI Assistant for help with.

Right-click in the _Git_ tool window and select **Explain Commits with AI Assistant**. The _AI Assistant_ tool window will open and generate an answer that summarises the commits you selected. This can be really helpful when you want to get a summary of someone else's commits, or you can't remember your own!
