How safe is TypeScript's type safety? How much can you trust your statically typed code? Can you even consider TypeScript's type system "strong"? In this talk, we look at situations where TypeScript fails badly and learn why things have to be that way. We talk about trade-offs, workarounds, and ultimately solutions for all the damn, terrible lies we tell ourselves when using TypeScript.
