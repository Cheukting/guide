Setting up JavaScript projects is no fun. Getting started involves installing and configuring node, tsc, prettier, eslint, a testing framework, a database driver, and more.

We explore what benefits full tooling integration unlocks and remember how fun it is to program if your tools help you rather than requiring your babysitting.
