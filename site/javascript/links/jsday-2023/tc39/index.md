Do you ever wonder how ECMAScript evolves and why it's available almost everywhere? We're going to take you through how TC39 (the technical committee responsible for ECMAScript) works, how to participate and contribute, as well as how an idea can make its way into the language, all step by step. We'll also provide a sneak peek and engage in a debate about some recent and interesting proposals in various stages of development.
