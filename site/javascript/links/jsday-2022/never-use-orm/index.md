What's an ORM? An Object-Relational Mapping tool (ORM) is a library for mapping a SQL table to a Class. In most cases,
ORMs force the users to structure their code to have Model objects that include both data access and business logic.

Once upon a time, I did several projects using ORMs, as I followed the common belief that they would simplify the
development and maintenance of projects. I was wrong. ORMs are often a hurdle to overcome for the most complex part of a
project.

As the next stop of my journey, I recommended people use the native languages of their databases, e.g., SQL. This works
great for the most part, but it creates quite a struggle: there is a lot of boilerplate code to write that can be quite
tedious. I was wrong, again.

Today I'm presenting you something new.
