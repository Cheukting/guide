The main goal behind creating Blitz was to give you a tool for rapid full-stack development with the best developer
experience possible. During my talk, I’ll introduce the core concepts and show what problems Blitz solves for you. We’ll
see how to read and write data from the client with full typesafety and without messing with HTTP or serialization.
We’ll also cover how to get more control over authentication and authorization with the Blitz Auth module, and how to
get started with a new application.
