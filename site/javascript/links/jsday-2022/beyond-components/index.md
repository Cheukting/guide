In this talk, we'll investigate how we ended up with 3 complicated component libraries instead of just a simple one and
why we still like it. Along this journey, we'll look at npm-package interactions, custom CSS-modules, custom CSS
properties, dual build tooling, multi-project TypeScript, and figure out how it all works (or doesn't).
