It is impossible to develop the UI-library on React and its documentation without usage examples with source code. Even
better if this code can be changed in-place and look at the component in the different situations - change the values,
props, the surrounding layout. And it looks easy - there are ready-to-use libraries for such playgrounds. But the
difficulties arise when the examples should support the imports of external dependencies. In this talk, weâ€™ll explain
how we implemented the live code-sandboxes inside markdown content with supporting imports for our new RescUI library.
