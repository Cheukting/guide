If you’re using Bootstrap or another CSS library linked from a CDN, you can get completion for the class names from that library – no need to add its sources to the project. For this, press <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) on the link in the HTML file and select _Download library_.
