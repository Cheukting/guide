Did you know that you can swiftly jump to the last opened file with <kbd>⌃⇥</kbd>+? (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Tab</kbd>+? (Windows/Linux). And, if you hold <kbd>⌃</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and press <kbd>⇥</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Tab</kbd> (Windows/Linux), you'll see the Switcher popup which you can use for jumping between tool windows and other recently opened files, also with <kbd>⇥</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Tab</kbd> (Windows/Linux).
