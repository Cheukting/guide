Focus on the [_Project_ tool window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/project-tool-window.html) and press <kbd>âŒ˜N</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Insert</kbd> (Windows/Linux) - WebStorm will open the _New_ popup. Use this popup to add a new file quickly. You can also create a new folder for that new file: type the name of the folder (or folders) and then add <kbd>/</kbd> before the file name.
