You'll find a list of all the shortcuts in WebStorm under _Preferences / Settings | Keymap_. Here you can search for the action name and see the assigned shortcut. You can also use the _Find Actions by Shortcut_ to tell you what action a keymap input performs.

Alternatively, you can use _Find Action_. Press _⇧⌘A / Ctrl+Shift+A_, search for an action, then you'll see the name of the action and its shortcut if it exists.
