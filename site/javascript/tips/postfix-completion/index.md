With postfix completion, you can transform an already existing expression into another one without moving the caret: simply type `.` and the abbreviation, then press <kbd>â‡¥</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Tab</kbd> (Windows/Linux). Find available abbreviations in **Preferences/Settings | Editor | General | Postfix Completion**.
