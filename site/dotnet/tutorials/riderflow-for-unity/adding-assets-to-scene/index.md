The scene view management toolbar is your compass for navigating complex scenes!

1. Use the search tool to find assets that you can use in the scene.
2. To add an asset to the scene, drag it from your search results directly into the scene.

Note that the search window stays open and allows you to drag assets from your search results directly into the scene.
