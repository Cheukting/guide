leadin: "**Profiling meets event tracing!** \U0001F91D\n\nTimeline profiling combines profiler data with event traces. What happens when an HTTP request is made?\n\nFilter profiling snapshots by allocations, exceptions, garbage collection, and combine that information with what's going on in file operations, LINQ queries, SQL calls, and so much more.\n\n### See Also\n- [Profile .NET Core application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/profiler/Profile_.NET_Core_Application.html)\n- [Trace an HTTP request](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/profiler/Get_Started_with_Timeline_Profiling_(Basic).html#http)\n"
