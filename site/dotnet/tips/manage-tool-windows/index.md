leadin: "**Too little space to work with?** \U0001F928\n\nIf you find yourself frequently resizing tool windows like for VCS or the terminal, then you should try one of the following:\n\n- With the **Undock** view mode a tool window will automatically hide as soon as it loses focus.\n- Using the **Maximize/restore tool window** action will put the active tool window at maximum available space, and will restore to the previous size on the second call.\n\nTry it now!️️ \U0001F913\n\n### See Also\n- [Rider - Working with Tool Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Tool_Windows.html)\n- [Rider - Window Layout Manager plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13005-window-layout-manager)\n"
