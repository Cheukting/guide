**Power your game development process** ⚡

Space comes with Git hosting, issue tracking, code reviews, documents, file storage, chats, and more. Space provides native integration with JetBrains Rider, a fast and powerful C# editor for Unity and Unreal Engine, and TeamCity, a general-purpose CI/CD solution with built-in Unity and Perforce support.

You can use Space in the cloud or self-host it on your own server. Space is here to assist in your game development journey, whether you're working with large teams, small teams, or external contributors. And it’s free for small teams!
