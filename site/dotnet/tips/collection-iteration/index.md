**Get your hands some rest!** 😌

Dealing with collection-like objects is easy if you have _live and postfix templates_ at your finger tips. Either write `foreach` as a single word, or add `.foreach` at the end of your collection object. Then, just hit <kbd>⇥</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Tab</kbd> (VS Windows/Linux) and confirm the different hotspot variables: collection object (only live template), type name vs. `var` keyword, and the iteration variable name. In most cases, the _variable name can already be inferred_ from the collection object name. Good naming pays off! 😉

Which way is your favorite? ⭐️
