leadin: "**Get your hands some rest!** \U0001F60C\n\nDealing with collection-like objects is easy if you have **live and postfix templates** at your finger tips. Either write `foreach` as a single word, or add `.foreach` at the end of your collection object. Then, just hit **TAB** and confirm the different hotspot variables: collection object (only live template), type name vs. `var` keyword, and the iteration variable name. In most cases, the **variable name can already be inferred** from the collection object name. Good naming pays off! \U0001F609\n\n Which way is your favorite? ⭐️\n\n### See Also\n- [Postfix Templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Postfix_Templates.html)\n- [Live Templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Using_Live_Templates.html)\n"
