There are **3 layers by default**: local machine, solution team-shared, and solution personal. Settings like code formatting or code inspections are particularly suitable to be saved in the team-shared layer and committed to the repository. Doing so ensures that our code is always consistently structured and allows our CI to use `inspectcode.exe` to create an **insightful report** for existing code smells.\n\nLet's keep our code base shiny! ☀️\U0001F308\n\n### See Also\n- [Establishing a Zero-Warning Policy](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2016/10/04/establishing-a-zero-warning-policy-with-resharpers-solution-wide-analysis/)\n- [ReSharper - Manage and Share settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Sharing_Configuration_Options.html)\n- [Rider - Introducing settings layers](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2017/02/20/rider-eap-update-code-style-settings-layers/)\n"
