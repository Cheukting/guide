leadin: "**How do these C# 8 features work again?** \U0001F914\n\nLearning new language constructs with Rider is just a matter of hitting **Alt-Enter**. Convert a `switch` statement to `switch` expression? Alt-Enter! Prefer compound assignments instead of simple assignments? Alt-Enter! Make use of `IAsyncDisposable` and `using` declarations? You know what – Alt-Enter! \U0001F643\n\nNote that most **quick-fixes can be applied in scopes**, for instance in the current method, type, file, or even for the whole solution.\n\nAlt-Enter – Probably the most important shortcut \U0001F913\n\n### See Also\n- [Indices, Ranges, and Null-coalescing Assignments](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2019/04/24/indices-ranges-null-coalescing-assignments-look-new-language-features-c-8/)\n- [Switch Expressions and Pattern-Based Usings](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2019/05/14/switch-expressions-pattern-based-usings-look-new-language-features-c-8/)\n- [Recursive Pattern Matching](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2019/07/09/recursive-pattern-matching-look-new-language-features-c-8/)\n- [Async Streams](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2019/09/16/async-streams-look-new-language-features-c-8/)\n- [ReSharper - Fix in Scope](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Analysis__Fix_in_Scope.html#)\n"
