Then, we use **Code | Move Statement Up/Down** to rearrange it. Despite the refactoring name, this also works for methods, properties and other members. Placing the caret at the closing brace of a block statement, like `if` or `while`, even lets us expand and shrink the scope.\n\n We can also reorder parameters of signatures. Again, we just place our caret on a particular parameter, and use **Code | Move Element Left/Right** to specify its new position. Note that if our method already has usages, we might consider using the **Change Signature** refactoring instead, which would update the argument order.\n\nAlright, now move move move! \U0001F447\U0001F60C\U0001F446\n\n### See Also\n- [Re-arrange code elements](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Coding_Assistance__Moving_Code_Elements.html)\n- [Extend/shrink selection](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Coding_Assistance__Extend_Shrink_Selection.html)\n- [Configuring Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Configuring_Keyboard_and_Mouse_Shortcuts.html#)\n"
