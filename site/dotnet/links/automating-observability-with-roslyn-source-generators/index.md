Collecting logs, traces, and metrics in .NET applications has become a breeze recently. With support for automatic instrumentation and an increasing number of libraries starting to generate telemetry signals, it's easier than ever to build observable software.

Manually instrumenting your existing software can be a pain, though. Instead of spending valuable time on this, what if we let the Roslyn compiler do it for us?

Join Denis in a fun coding session, where we will automate the process of instrumenting our codebase using Roslyn source generators. We will implement a well-known structural design pattern using incremental source generators and a sprinkle of OpenTelemetry.
