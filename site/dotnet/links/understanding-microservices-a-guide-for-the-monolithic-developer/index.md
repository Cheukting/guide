Microservice Architecture has been thoroughly discussed, as have the reasons why you should move to it (and why you shouldn’t). If you have already decided to move over to microservices from monolithic development, then you may find the whole process a bit daunting. What aspects should you, as a developer, be concerned with? What does all the terminology mean? How do the services talk to each other?

In this session, I’ll show you how to get started with microservice architecture, answering these and many other questions. We'll look at The Tacky Tacos project, built with ASP.NET 6, and explore how the whole process fits together from a development point of view.
