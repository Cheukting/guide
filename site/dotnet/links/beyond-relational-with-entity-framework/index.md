Entity Framework Core is great for performing crud operations, but did you know you can also go beyond basic relational queries? For example, do you need to store and query unstructured data in JSON documents? Do you have hierarchical data that you wish to query with EF Core? Are you required to keep historical information about data that has been modified or maybe even deleted? If you answered "Yes" to any of the above questions, this is the talk you do not want to miss.

In this session, you will see how to achieve the above goals with EF Core. Specifically, I will step through and show how you can use EF Core for JSON documents, how to use temporal tables to keep the complete history of your data and query hierarchical data with EF Core 8.

Developers working with EF Core will learn to store data in JSON columns and how easily they can drill into the JSON data with familiar LINQ query syntax. You will see how to filter and sort results based on elements of the JSON document, project elements from JSON, and even update the JSON document. Furthermore, you will see how temporal tables can store all the historical data and how straightforward it is to query for historical records with EF Core. Finally, I will show how to query hierarchical data with the upcoming version of EF Core 8. Join me for a demo-rich session and learn about EF Core features that you can apply right after the session.
