One of the goals of building microservice-based architectures is to reduce the complexity of individual components. In doing so, much of that complexity shifts from individual services towards interservice communication, making how we design those service interactions essential to our system design. That's where orchestration and choreography come in – two coordination techniques that can help us design complex workflows in our system.

In this session, we’ll thoroughly examine each pattern with practical examples from the banking sector that are based on almost five years of experience in this domain. By thoroughly understanding the trade-offs of each approach and understanding the right questions to ask, we can build a mental framework that helps us make well-balanced decisions about which pattern to use. Join me in this session, where we’ll transform the abstract concepts of orchestration and choreography into a tangible decision-making framework that steers you in the right direction!
