We tend to call some F# language features "lifesavers", but what if I told you we actually built software for saving lives? In this talk, I'll walk you through designing custom DSLs for applications used by emergency operations center controllers with a pinch of C# and F# interop on the top of a SignalR- and Fable Compiler-powered UI renderer.
