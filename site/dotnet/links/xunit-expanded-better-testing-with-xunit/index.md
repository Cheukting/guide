xUnit is one of the most-used testing tools for C#, yet its full capability often goes underutilized. Unfortunately, there isn't much guidance or documentation for developers in terms of what libraries to use with xUnit or some of the more uncommon functionality of xUnit itself, keeping much of its use limited to the realm of learned experience. This talk will cover some xUnit tips and tricks that come from just that: learned experience. You'll learn how to make tests easier to write and more robust, as well as other helpful libraries that can be used in tandem with xUnit to unlock its full potential.
