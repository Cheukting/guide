In this session, we’ll explore Blazing Story, a template inspired by Storybook that allows developers to develop Blazor components in isolation. We’ll discuss the use of Playwright for end-to-end testing and explore the integration of an accessibility testing library to ensure that the components comply with the agreed guidelines.
