In this talk, you will see how features added to recent versions of C# can dramatically improve parsing and generation of JSON data compared with longer-established .NET JSON handling mechanisms. You will see how to use high-performance memory-efficient techniques, and also how code generators can reduce runtime overheads. This talk will explore the tradeoff between maximizing performance and ease of use and will show you how to choose between the various options now available in modern .NET applications.
