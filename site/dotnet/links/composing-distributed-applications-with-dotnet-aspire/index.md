The .NET Aspire stack bundles together an opinionated collection of libraries and tooling designed to streamline the development of distributed applications for developers. At the heart of .NET Aspire is its built-in orchestrator, which offers a code-centric approach, allowing you to effortlessly manage all the resources that make up your application – containers, executables, projects, and configurations – with the power of strong typing.

In this session, we’ll explore how you can use the API in the application model to compose the resources that make up our distributed application. We’ll get a solid understanding of what Aspire Resources are, explore some of the built-in resource types, as well as learn how we can create our own custom resources.
