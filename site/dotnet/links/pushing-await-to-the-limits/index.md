After the introduction of the await operator, C# developers can write asynchronous code in a way that looks almost like regular synchronous code. There's no more need for explicit callbacks and lambda expressions in certain scenarios. Great! However, it did not add a solution for multi-threaded programming. With the help of IAsyncDisposable, IAsyncEnumerable, and some custom task-like types, we can make multi-threading as easy as async/await. Come learn how to make async/await even more powerful and unlock the way to write multithreaded code cleanly and concisely.
