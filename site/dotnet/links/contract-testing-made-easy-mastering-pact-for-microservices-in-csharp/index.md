In a forever-evolving world of microservices, with so many moving parts, we often rely on integration testing to prevent bugs and regressions.

The problem with these tests is that sometimes they become flaky, unreliable, and expensive to maintain and execute, due to the distributed nature of our system.

But what if we could ensure that our system’s components are compatible and can communicate with each other straight from the development phase?

Let’s have a look at what contract testing is and see how it can help us mitigate the risk of integration bugs before running long tests, with examples in C#.
