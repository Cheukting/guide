ASP.NET was a bit behind the curve when it came to the MVC pattern. It was not until 2009 that Microsoft released the first version of ASP.NET MVC. This was a time when the MVC pattern was already well-established in the web development community. Part of the reason for this was that Microsoft was initially heavily invested in WebForms. Later, they pivoted to Silverlight as the future of web development. Aside from legacy projects, WebForms is now a thing of the past. Silverlight is also long gone.

Today, there's a lot of talk about the new and shiny Blazor. But I'm not convinced that it will fully replace ASP.NET MVC. And I'm not convinced that it should. This talk will be a homage to the good old (new) ASP.NET Core MVC. In it, Iâ€™ll explain why I think it's still a good choice for web development in 2024.
