This deep dive will reveal the magic behind how Rider seamlessly integrates with Blazor WebAssembly to provide a dynamic, real-time development experience. We'll explore the technical architecture, delve into the communication mechanisms between the IDE, the runtime, and the browser, and understand how code changes are instantly reflected without a full reload. Perfect for developers looking to enhance their knowledge of Blazor capabilities, this session will provide a thorough understanding of the behind-the-scenes processes that make hot reload a powerful tool in your Blazor Wasm development toolkit.
