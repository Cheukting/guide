Maksim Sobolevskiy is the team lead of DataGrip. The webinar focuses on the powerful database tools available in JetBrains Rider and DataGrip. This webinar provided a deep dive into the database functionalities of Rider and DataGrip, demonstrating their extensive toolset for improving productivity, performance, and overall database management within JetBrains IDEs.

## Overview of DataGrip and JetBrains Rider

- Explained the integration of database tools within Rider and DataGrip, highlighting that the same database features are available across all JetBrains IDEs.
- DataGrip is the standalone SQL IDE from JetBrains, while Rider includes these database features for .NET development.

## Adding and Managing Data Sources

- Demonstrated how to add a new data source and the extensive list of supported databases (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
- Explained the introspection process for indexing database objects, which enhances features like navigation and code completion.
- Tips for selecting specific schemas for better performance and organization, and utilizing folders and color settings to manage data sources.

## Query Console

- The query console in Rider allows running SQL queries with features like live templates for common SQL statements.
- Highlighted the importance of the "alt + enter" shortcut for improving code.
- Demonstrated how to run multiple queries, including subqueries, and how to name query result tabs for better organization.

## Code Completion and Inspections

- Rider provides intelligent code completion and inspections, which help in writing error-free SQL code.
- Tools like "qualify identifier" and "expand column list" improve query readability and performance.

## Editing and Navigating Data

- Data editor features for sorting, filtering, and manipulating data directly within the IDE.
- Multi-cursor editing and real-time updates to reflect changes in the database.
- Explained navigation by foreign keys and the filtering options for efficient data browsing.

## Data Export and Import

- DataGrip's data extractors allow exporting data in various formats (SQL, JSON, CSV, etc.).
- Ability to copy result sets between different databases.
- Features like clipboard history and exporting data to files or other databases were demonstrated.

## Schema Comparison and Migration

- Demonstrated the schema comparison tool for generating migration scripts.
- Introspected schema differences and generated scripts to synchronize schemas between databases.

## Viewing and Editing Execution Plans

- Showed how to view and analyze execution plans for optimizing query performance.
- Visual modes for execution plans help in identifying and resolving performance issues.

## Stored Procedures and Function Support

- Editing and updating stored procedures directly in the IDE with real-time updates.
- Support for searching within stored procedure code and various other objects using the search and navigation features.

## Additional Tools and Features

- Discussed extensions like the Geo viewer for geographic data and language injections for embedding SQL within code.
- Emphasized the benefits of the introspection process for enhancing productivity and performance.
