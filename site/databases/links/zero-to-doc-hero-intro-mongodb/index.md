Once upon a time, relational databases, or RDMS (think SQL), were the only data store in town. But now thereâ€™s a competitor, a group of non-SQL (aka NoSQL) databases, including document databases such as MongoDB.

In this talk, you will learn about the primary differences between them, what MongoDB is, including its full developer data platform, why document databases are so powerful, how MongoDB can be used with .NET, and some really cool uses cases that show databases can be cool ;).

By the end of the talk, you should walk away realising that SQL isn't the only way.
