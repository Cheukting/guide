SQL is extremely good for data retrieval and calculating basic statistics, whereas Python comes into its own when you need in-depth, flexible exploratory data analysis or data science. What if you could use both programming languages inside of one tool?

In this webinar, Alena Guzharina will demonstrate how you can effectively combine SQL and Python in Datalore. Alena will show you how to:

- Quickly understand and visualize SQL query results.
- Seamlessly transition from SQL to Python in one notebook.
- Parameterize SQL queries with Python variables.
- Share your results and automate the whole workflow for the future.
